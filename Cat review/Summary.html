      <p>Here at Cat reviews we review cat images and tell you when and where they were taken. This site is for cats only, no dogs.</p>
      <p>However, we may make a site about parrots in masks soon, though there is no guarantee.</p>
      <p>We review the best cat photos and show them to you. There is currently a pandemic going on so we propose some photos of cats in masks.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This is site frequently updated so you can keep enjoying new cat photos! However, this site is a one man project so you shouldn't be expecting too much.</p>
